# Buffet

It might happen that we came to know about things later than we expect to learn it earlier. This is because there is an ocean of technologies and when we choose one and spend our substantial time to find a worthy resource and meanwhile we skip many things which are required along with the tech we choose.

Here comes `Buffet` ! A collection of all the tech stack we know about. Here we categorize all the techs to make it simpler for the folks to learn faster. `Buffet` tells what technologies are available for different development field along with the resources from where folks can easily learn those techs.
